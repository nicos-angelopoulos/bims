put the transformed program to a separate file, not -stats

Start using modules:
	likelihood    bims_lkl
	data          bims_data  (carts then use data: for the actual data)
	prior         (i think this is already the case, add name here)

Delete
	the modules 

Test 
	by runing a run of carts then one of bns
